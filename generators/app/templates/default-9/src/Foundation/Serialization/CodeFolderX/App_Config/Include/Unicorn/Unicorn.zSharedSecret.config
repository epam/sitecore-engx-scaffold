<!--
SHARED SECRET CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE
This is a config file that can be used as a basis to set the Unicorn PowerShell remote API's shared secret 
without altering the stock config file. Duplicate this file and set a long, 32+ character secret to enable
invoking Unicorn with the PowerShell API, e.g. for CI.

IMPORTANT: THIS CONFIG PATCH *MUST* RUN AFTER Unicorn.UI.config, or you will receive an error:
"Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'Unicorn.ControlPanel.Security.IUnicornAuthenticationProvider'."

See the README here for more on setting up remote API: https://github.com/kamsar/Unicorn
